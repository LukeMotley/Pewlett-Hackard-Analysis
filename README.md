## Summary:
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There will be a total of 90,398 positions that will need to be filled.

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are a total of 1,940 employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

PH could face a great deficit if enough employees retire at once.
Since the potential vacuum is so wide, it would be wise to run individual queries by the month to find the stream of retirements. It would also be helpful to broaden the parameters for the mentorship program. 2,000 against 90,000 positions is a non-starter, so while it may not pull the most adept employees into the vacant positions, it may need to be done. Other queries that might providee more insight are looking at the relationship between salary, title, and retention rate.
